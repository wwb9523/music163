 edson-Birth! School! Dole! Angst!
唱：edson
瑞典清新吉他流行五人乐队edson
成立于1998年北欧的夏天，
在他们的音乐中，那轻快节奏的空心吉他，浪漫老式键琴的背景，
忧伤感性的旧民谣风韵，让你可以很单纯的放松自己
You don＇t have to be pitiful about me
There＇s no need to be merciful to spare me
You don＇t have to be pitiful about me
Cause I have got a pocket full of treasury
You don＇t have to worry
You don＇t have to cry
There will be another time
You don＇t have to worry
This is not goodbye
You don＇t have to worry
I＇ll be fine
I never meant to live a lie
No I, I still believe in honesty
And I tried
to tell you about a year ago-honestly
And now I have deceitful written all over me
You don＇t have to worry
You don＇t have to cry
There will be another time
You don＇t have to worry
This is not goodbye
You don＇t have to worry
I＇ll be fine
You don＇t have to worry
You don＇t have to cry
There will be another time
Darling I＇m sorry
I can＇t tell you why
You don＇t have to worry
I＇ll survive
Birth! School! Dole! Angst!
Birth! School! Sex! Love!
Birth! School! Dole! Angst!
Birth! School! Sex! Love!
