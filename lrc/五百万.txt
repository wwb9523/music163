我个生活加起来就是上班帮下班 every day I do only two things: going to work and getting off it
跟爷娘住勒一道么 开销也好省眼 I live with my parents in order to spend less money
看看镜子里向自家也算一表人才 looking into the mirror I consider myself kind of handsome
但是去相亲人家总先问侬有勿有房产 but in a bind date people will always ask first whether you have a house property
假使我有500万 if I have five million
我定规要去买套房间 surly I will buy a house
搿样我就拥有了勿动产 then I will have a real estate
寻起老婆来是一眼也勿难 it would be much easier to date girls
我最欢喜去厦门看海 I enjoy spending my time by the sea in Xiamen
再到丽江听听民谣发发呆 then go to Lijiang to listen to the folk music in a daze
看看镜子里向白衣飘飘个年代 looking into the mirror of my artistic youth
耳机里唱个永远是爱情跟浪漫 earphones replaying the love romance
假使我有500万 if I have five million
我再也勿会去买房产 I won’t buy any house
我要去希腊看爱琴海 I will go to the Aegean Sea in Greece
还要去瑞士爬雪山 and go climbing snow mountain in Switz
500万 500万 five million, five million
人人侪有伊个搿笔500万 everyone has his own five million
500万 500万 five million, five million
哪恁用好侬个搿笔500万 how to spend well your own five million
500万 500万 five million, five million
人人侪有伊个搿笔500万 everyone has his own five million
500万 500万 five million, five million
哪恁用光侬个搿笔500万 how to spend up your own five million
