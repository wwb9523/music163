Angels We Have Heard On High(荒野の果てに)
フランス民谣
「マリア様がみてる」シリーズ クリスマスソング

Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains;
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.
Gloria in excelsis Deo;
Gloria in excelsis Deo!

Come to Bethlehem,and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come on adore on bended knee,
Christ, the Lord, our new-born King.
